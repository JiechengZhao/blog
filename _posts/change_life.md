A few months ago, I experienced my first business failure. It left me feeling sad and unproductive, causing me to lose my rhythm in life. I began wasting a lot of time on Twitter, other social media platforms, Pornhub, and games. It was terrible. Recently, I’ve wanted to break out of this state and recover, and things have started to change.

## The Influence of Positive Content

Perhaps because I’ve been reading and viewing success stories and advice on social media, the algorithms have begun to push more positive, relevant content my way. This content includes motivational stories, productivity tips, and success strategies that I find inspiring. It has helped me understand myself better and start to change.

Interestingly, while social media often distracts me and makes things worse, it also responds to my needs. When I want to break free from my negative state, it pushes content like “Avoid distractions from social media and change your life.” As Paulo Coelho’s 'The Alchemist' suggests, when you truly want to do something, the whole world conspires to help you. My experience with social media pushing helpful content is an example of this.

## Taking Action: Exercise and Routine Changes

This morning, I stopped viewing social media and began exercising. I’ve become weak over the past few years, but I want to be strong again. The good thing is I was strong once, and I know the tricks. I looked at my phone; it was 6:22, and I decided to exercise for 30 minutes.

I started with some simple warm-up activities, lifting my arms and legs several times to ensure they were relaxed and wouldn’t get injured later. I excelled at Tai Chi during my university years. Although my home doesn’t have much space, I still manage to practice some key movements. They make me feel calm, active, and strong. I also do movements like back kicks to activate my back muscles. Since I sit a lot for work, my back needs regular activity and relaxation to prevent stiffness and pain.

After 30 minutes, I felt much better. I took a short rest and had my breakfast. I usually hurried to sit in front of the computer to pretend to work after breakfast. But today, I stopped. I know whatever I do in front of the computer is not working. Maybe I will type some words or code, but soon I will be distracted by something and begin wasting time. So why not stop and think about what is really good to do in this small piece of time?

## Changing the Rhythm: Don’t Hurry for Nothing

After the stop, I cleaned up the table and the desk. I usually do not like cleaning. In my childhood, I felt it was terrible. I usually spent hours making things tidy but could not achieve a perfect result. I confronted the fear from my deep heart and fixed it. I said to myself, I will spend 10 minutes cleaning up and then stop. No matter how much I clean, it would be better than doing no cleaning, and it won’t be terrible if I cannot achieve perfection.

After that, I sent my daughter to kindergarten. When I got back from the kindergarten, I opened social media again. One question on social media attracted me. Oh, I was distracted again. I suddenly forgot what I was going to do today. Luckily, I stopped and found my way back. I did not answer that question but continued with my original plan!

## Conclusion

I feel happy with this morning. I record this and hope it will be a good beginning to change my life.

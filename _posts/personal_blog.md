The first step is to honestly evaluate my situation. Currently, I'm facing a severe career crisis. I've been unable to generate income from my startups, and I have given up. Additionally, finding a job in the current labor market has proven difficult. On a positive note, I still have some savings, and my family continues to support me. However, I'm aware that this situation cannot last forever, as my savings will eventually deplete. While things are manageable now, the future holds additional financial pressures, such as my child's education, which will require significant funds. There's also the concern that my wife might leave if I'm perpetually unable to contribute financially, though I know she still loves me very much. Without a change in direction, I'll face old age without any financial security or insurance, a scenario I desperately need to avoid.

Thus, my path remains clear: to continue as an entrepreneur. I must create a successful business; there seems to be no alternative. This is my mission. I need to assess my strengths and decide on my next steps. I've taken the first lesson from the startup course offered by Y Combinator and Stanford. In it, Altman discusses essential qualities for startups, many of which I lack:

1. 2-3 co-founders. I'm on my own, although my wife could perhaps be considered a partial co-founder.
2. Altman emphasizes the need for co-founders to be quick, decisive, and creative, always ready for anything. While . I may not be the quickest decision-maker and often hesitate, but I am creative and open to many possibilities.
3. Altman advises against working remotely, yet that is my only option.
4. Altman suggests dedicating a significant amount of time to the startup. As a household husband, I can only commit about 40 hours a week to my career.
All these points suggest challenges ahead. So, what's the solution? Fortunately, many solo developers argue that these requirements may not be as crucial. Perhaps their advice is worth considering, but I still need to understand why Altman advises as he does and what key points I should be mindful of.

1. Co-founder Considerations: Having a person to brainstorm with is crucial. My wife, while not experienced in some areas, is highly insightful and can offer significant support. Her unique perspective could be invaluable.
2. Remote Work as an Advantage: Operating remotely can be advantageous for small businesses, offering flexibility and cost savings. Overcoming communication challenges is essential, requiring effective tools and strategies to ensure team cohesion and productivity.
3. With restricted work hours, prioritizing tasks and maintaining focus is crucial.

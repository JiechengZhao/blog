As I've decided to exit the cryptocurrency industry, I've found myself in a challenging job situation. Returning to my previous industry as an employee isn't viable due to significant layoffs, and my two-year gap is making it challenging to be considered for hiring. Since I've lost faith in the cryptocurrency sector, continuing my experience in that field is not an option. It's disheartening to realize that I'm facing unemployment, even when considering self-employment. The situation is becoming increasingly precarious.

I have two potential paths ahead. Let's explore each option thoroughly before making a clear decision.

### Option 1: Starting a New Business

One potential avenue I'm considering is starting a new business. A potential business might aim at assisting small businesses in utilizing advanced analytics techniques. While many small businesses use Google Analytics for website visitor analysis, its capabilities are somewhat limited. Larger companies often employ AB testing or reinforcement learning for more in-depth insights. While I believe there's potential to fill this gap and help small businesses benefit from such techniques, it's important to acknowledge the uncertainty involved in starting a new business. While AB testing is a candidate approach, it's not guaranteed to be the optimal solution for every business. Additionally, the success of a new venture is never guaranteed, and there are numerous challenges and risks associated with entrepreneurship.

Notably, Umami, a platform similar to Google Analytics, has garnered 4.6 million downloads from GitHub. Although Umami initially lacked AB testing support, its event system now enables this feature. This presents a promising opportunity to integrate AB testing into Umami and offer enhanced analytics solutions to small businesses. However, further research and validation are necessary to determine the viability and potential success of this venture.

### Option 2: Pursuing a Ph.D.

Another option I'm considering is pursuing a Ph.D. This would entail dedicating several years to a research idea, providing a semblance of stability compared to starting a business. While involving myself in a joint research direction in symbolic math and machine learning in a university is a feasible option, I must admit that I don't consider myself exceptionally talented in symbolic math. Additionally, it seems that this field is highly competitive and extensively explored.

I joined the Leanprover community, an academic community about symbolic math, last year, and I really like this community. The people in the community are great, and their work and goals are also great. But right now, I'm not able to use my main skills effectively in it. Besides, given that I'm around 35 years old, this might not be the most suitable option. It seems a bit late for a Ph.D. and post-Ph.D. journey.

### Conclusion

After careful consideration, I'm leaning towards exploring Option 1 further. While the idea of starting my own business presents numerous challenges and uncertainties, it also offers the potential for innovation and impact. I will continue to research and evaluate both options before making a final decision.

As I've decided to exit the cryptocurrency industry, I've found myself in a challenging job situation. Returning to my previous industry as an employee isn't viable due to significant layoffs. Additionally, my two-year gap is making it challenging to be considered for hiring. Since I've lost faith in the cryptocurrency sector, continuing my experience in that field is not an option. It's disheartening to realize that I'm facing unemployment, even when considering self-employment. The situation is becoming increasingly precarious.

I have two potential paths ahead. Some individuals suggest pursuing a Ph.D., but given that I'm around 35 years old, this might not be the most suitable option. It seems a bit late for a Ph.D. and post-Ph.D. journey.

The alternative is to start my own business in another area. To embrace the belief that the world is vast, and I can discover something valuable for people. It involves starting afresh, which is challenging but perhaps the direction I am inclined to take.

The second option, starting my own business, seems tougher and more uncertain. Many people struggle with establishing their businesses, and I've faced failures in my attempts. However, there's a sense of freedom and intrigue in entrepreneurship, involving understanding people's genuine needs, engaging with customers, and grasping the lives of ordinary individuals.

On the contrary, pursuing a Ph.D. entails dedicating several years to a research idea, providing a semblance of stability. While the challenges of thesis writing and graduation persist, they might be more manageable compared to starting a business. The drawback, however, lies in its routine nature and potential lack of interest. Additionally, if I discover that I lack talent in the chosen area, it could prove challenging to transition out of the academic path.

So let's view the opportunity one by one carefully and see which way to choose and make a clear decision.

Option 1: Start a new business. The concept revolves around assisting small businesses on the internet in utilizing advanced analytics techniques. While many small businesses use Google Analytics for website visitor analysis, its capabilities are somewhat limited. Larger companies often employ AB testing or reinforcement learning for more in-depth insights. I believe there's potential to fill this gap and help small businesses benefit from such techniques. Notably, Umami, a platform similar to Google Analytics, has garnered 4.6 million downloads from GitHub. Although Umami initially lacked AB testing support, its event system now enables this feature. This presents a promising opportunity to integrate AB testing into Umami and offer enhanced analytics solutions to small businesses.

Option 2: Involves pursuing a joint research direction in symbolic math and machine learning in a university. While this is a feasible option, I must admit that I don't consider myself exceptionally talented in symbolic math. Additionally, it seems that this field is highly competitive and extensively explored.

I personally lean towards Option 1. Upon my research, I've found a lack of robust open-source AB test solutions on GitHub. Considering its significance and my own expertise in this area, I believe it could be a critical venture.

For Option 2, I really like the Leanprover community. The people in the community are great, and their work and goals are also great. But right now, I'm not able to use my main skills effectively in it. So, I have to think about other options.

So, I'm embarking on this journey. I will initiate the creation of this blog and endeavor to inject some captivating content into it while integrating AB testing. Initially, I'll conduct AB tests on my site and subsequently share this knowledge with others.

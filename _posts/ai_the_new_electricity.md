About a year ago, a question on Zhihu asked how ordinary people can benefit from AI. My answer is simple: treat AI like electricity. Use it, help others use it, and watch the benefits unfold. Just as electricity transformed our world, AI will do the same.

## Consumers Will Be Innovators

Initially, people used electricity mainly for lighting and motoring. Now, it powers everything from homes to industries. Similarly, AI started with basic applications like virtual assistants and recommendation systems. However, its potential goes far beyond these uses. The interesting thing is, the more people used electricity, the more they discovered new ways to utilize it. Consumers became innovators, applying electricity to new uses, especially in household appliances.

## Learning and Creating with AI

The same progression will happen with AI. As more people use AI, they learn how to use it more effectively and discover new applications. They see areas where current AI products can be improved or applied differently, leading to innovation. Ordinary people can transition from consumers to innovators, developing new AI applications that solve real-world problems.

For example, many people who use ChatGPT extensively start to see themselves as task adaptors for AI. Some of them begin writing code to automate tasks, effectively replacing their roles and achieving full automation. This shift from user to innovator drives AI's evolution and expands its impact.

## Conclusion

AI, like electricity, is a transformative resource. By using AI and helping others learn how to use it, ordinary people can transition from consumers to innovators. This shift unlocks AIâ€™s full potential, leading to new solutions and improved lives. Follow me for more insights and experiences on how to explore AI and experiment with it. Together, we can discover new ways to use this powerful resource and create a better future.
